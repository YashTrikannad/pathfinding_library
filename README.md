# planner_library
Developing a Standard Templated Planning Library for Deterministic and Stochastic Planning Environments in a grid world

The graph can run algorithms on 2D Eigen Matrices and 2D STL vectors. Support will soon be provided for 3D Tensor and 3D Vectors too. 

Currently supporting few deterministic planners:
1. A-star search
2. BFS graph search
3. DFS graph search

Future / Ongoing work on:
1. Jump Point Search
2. D-Star
3. Potential Fields
4. Obstacle expansion
